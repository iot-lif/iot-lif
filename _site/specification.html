    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>Radio communication plays an important role in modern day life and
shapes the way people are able to communicate with each other through
mobile devices. A growing number of communication services (like the 5G
mobile phone network) need to share a very limited frequency spectrum.
The ability to share the same frequency range for different services
could therefore be useful in the future, but requires being able to
classify and recognise received radio signals by the service they belong
to. In this project, we aim to implement an efficient and low-power
computing system to classify radio signals. Our method will be based on
a learning system inspired by biological neurons and will be evaluated
using RadioML, a publicly available dataset of radio signals.</p>

<p>This page is available as PDF <a href="/assets/other/lif_project_specification.pdf">here</a></p>

<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Traditional radio communication devices consist of dedicated hardware
units for various signal processing tasks (e.g. amplifiers, filters,
modulator). Cheaper and more powerful modern digital computing hardware
enables us to perform many of these tasks in software instead of
hardware.</p>

<p>This approach has the advantage that besides performing traditional
signal processing tasks, the computer is able to assist with additional
tasks like classification of the received radio signal (modulation
classification). Such classification can for example be useful in
non-cooperative communication settings (e.g. military units trying to
decode communication of hostile forces) or generally for detecting the
type of service transmitted at specific frequencies.</p>

<p>Machine learning has proved to be an effective approach for performing
complex classification tasks. As described in the following section, an
implementation for this modulation classification task already exists
using a traditional convolutional network. For this project, we will
examine the use of a novel type of neural network, the so-called spiking
neural network (SNN), which is inspired by biological neuronal processes
in the brains of animals and humans.</p>

<h2 id="previous-work">Previous Work</h2>

<p>In one previous effort (), our project lead and several other
collaborators performed a study of the efficacy and complexity of
several deep learning models as applied to the RadioML automatic
modulation classification task. In that project, the best performing
models were convolutional networks (ResNet and VGG) with large numbers
of parameters and operations. The networks were basically architected to
perform a number of convolutions on the input radio signals before
reducing the activations to per-class probabilities using a softmax
layer. We plan to use this project as a baseline with which we can
compare our own results.</p>

<p>Since spiking neural networks are much less developed than traditional
neural networks, it is unlikely that our less complex model will perform
up to par with the existing ResNet and VGG approaches. However, this is
okay because our motivation for using SNNs comes from the fact that the
associated computational complexity and power requirements can be less
than those of traditional CNN-based counterparts. Given the highly
real-time nature of the problem and the need for limited memory and
power consumption on an FPGA, these aspects of the solution are more
important to consider than they would usually be. For example, the
ResNet, while it performed the best of all models, could not be
implemented on an FPGA with high throughput because it was too large and
required too much on-chip memory to store intermediate activations. Thus
we consider it an important component of our project to quantify the
performance of our models <em>relative to their parameter counts and
computational requirements</em>.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="snn-with-deep-continuous-local-learning">SNN with Deep Continuous Local Learning</h2>

<p>For our approach, we plan to follow the spiking neural network method
called “Deep Continuous Local Learning” (DECOLLE) that is outlined in .
It provides a novel way to train SNNs, which are event or spike-based
networks that are naturally equipped to process temporal data (which can
be represented as spikes over time) and that are theoretically more
powerful than artificial neural networks because of the differences in
their neuron design. The problem with SNNs is that spikes over time are
not differentiable, so they are difficult to train with the standard
optimization methods of today (e.g. stochastic gradient descent) which
require the ability to compute gradients of the loss function with
respect to every parameter in the network.</p>

<p>DECOLLE solves that problem by using auxiliary classifiers on a
per-layer basis to provide local classification signals for each linear
integrate &amp; fire (LIF) neuron level in the SNN. LIF neurons are modeled
after biological neurons and are represented by a number of state
variables such as membrane potential and resetting state.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="project-parts">Project Parts</h2>

<p>We intend to build off of the code provided by the authors of the
DECOLLE paper, extending their work according to the following sequence
of steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Implementing a larger spiking neural network for RadioML based on
the dcll library, which is modeled after the VGG network
architecture used in .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optimizing this network for RadioML classification accuracy by
tuning various hyperparameters like learning rate, momentum, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extending the Brevitas quantization library to support spiking
neural networks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Training a quantized version of the RadioML SNN and optimizing it
for model size, memory bandwidth, and speed while maintaining as
high of an accuracy as possible</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="further-extensions">Further Extensions</h2>

<p>Eventually, the model created for this project should be able to run on
dedicated hardware (e.g. to be used in Sofware Defined Radios) which
means that similarly to the VGG used in <em>Previous Work</em>, an FPGA
implementation will be desirable.</p>

<p>FPGAs are customizable computer chips that can be programmed for
specific purposes using a hardware description language. Compared to
processors where the hardware structure is fixed and only software can
be modified, an FPGA allows the programmer to adapt the configuration
and wiring of the entire computer chip to the needs of the project. Due
to this property, FPGAs deviate from the standard sequential processor
model and can perform many separate operations in parallel which makes
FPGAs well suited for the implementation of neural networks.</p>

<p>There is some uncertainty in this project around how easy it will be to
adapt the Brevitas library for spiking neural networks. If it turns out
that no considerable progress is made in this regard, we may revise the
schedule and focus on the FPGA implementation of the RadioML SNN instead
of its quantization.</p>

<h1 id="project-objectives">Project Objectives</h1>

<p>Our overall objective is to train an SNN model which approximates
previous VGG/ResNet accuracies on RadioML modulation classification and
train a quantized version of the same network to optimize for computing
power and memory. We plan to work toward our large-scale goal by
producing the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="sans-serif"><strong>An SNN network for RadioML trained using
DECOLLE:</strong></span><br>
Based on the dcll Python library provided with , we plan to create a
model trained using the RadioML dataset for modulation
classification. This model will be evaluated on accuracy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="sans-serif"><strong>A quantized version of the SNN network
for RadioML:</strong></span><br>
In order to prepare the SNN for effective and fast computation, we
intend to create a quantized version of the neural network using the
Python library Brevitas. This network will be evaluated on its
required space, computational efficiency (timing) and accuracy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="feasibility-and-risks">Feasibility and Risks</h1>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>In one sense, there is a risk that the DECOLLE spiking neural network
will not perform well on the RadioML dataset, as SNNs are difficult to
train and do not currently produce results on par with traditional deep
learning schemes. We would likely need to develop or utilize new
SNN-based optimization methods in order to resolve this; however, that
is not the focus of this project. Here we are primarily interested in
seeing how well we can do with the current training methods, and
potentially quantifying the performance gains (in terms of compute and
memory) of DECOLLE over VGG, with and without quantization.</p>

<h2 id="training-time--hyperparameter-tuning">Training Time / Hyperparameter Tuning</h2>

<p>Another difficulty and contributor to risk stems from the fact that deep
learning methods require a significant amount of training time, meaning
there is a long turnaround before we are able to see a result – and the
result might not even be good or valid (due to implementation error,
poorly-chosen hyperparameters, or the limitations of the method).
Optimizing hyperparameters to get good training results may require many
iterations of the same training process which can potentially delay
project progress. We will try to alleviate this problem by making
healthy use of the GPU cluster, where we have the ability to run
multiple experiments in parallel for faster development, and by
allocating sufficient time for the tedious process of hyperparameter
tuning in the schedule.</p>

<h1 id="group-management">Group Management</h1>

<p>We plan to make decisions by consensus (taking into account the advice
of our project lead) and to communicate via Slack channel, making Skype
calls as necessary. We will report weekly progress to our project lead
via Slack.</p>

<p>Progress will be monitored using the milestone schedule. If we
experience significant delays of our milestones due to problems
encountered, we may revise the schedule and focus our efforts on
creating an optimized RadioML SNN (without quantization). In case the
Brevitas implementation causes problems in particular, we may instead
develop an FPGA implementation of the RadioML SNN and leave the
quantization as a further extension to the project for teams later on.</p>

<p>Owen’s main focus will be the implementation of the SNN in PyTorch using
the DCLL library while Simon will work on the quantization of SNNs using
Brevitas. We recognize that there is some uncertainty around the areas
with the most time-consuming challenges for the project. Therefore, this
division is tentative and we will stay in regular contact throughout the
project to combine our efforts in overcoming the main challenges.</p>

<h1 id="project-development">Project Development</h1>

<h2 id="software-components">Software Components</h2>

<p>Development for this project is mostly software-based. These are the
main software components that we will use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><span class="sans-serif">dcll</span></strong>, a Python library built on
top of PyTorch implementing spiking neural networks and the DECOLLE
learning rule</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><span class="sans-serif">Brevitas</span></strong>, a Python library based
on PyTorch for quantization-aware training of neural networks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><span class="sans-serif">Vivado HLS</span></strong>, a software package
for high level synthesis and simulation of hardware designs for
FPGAs</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Owen will focus more on the adaptation of the dcll library, while Simon
will be working with Brevitas. Nevertheless, since many of the software
components are related, we will both be involved with all major parts of
the project.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>The training of neural networks can be computationally very expensive
and works best on GPU clusters maintained for this purpose. For this
project we will have access to the GPU cluster run by the university.</p>

<p>The codebase will be maintained on a shared GitHub repository to allow
for effective collaboration and version control. Documentation for our
codebase will be maintained using README files in markdown format which
allows us to integrate code and documentation effectively within the
same repository.</p>

<p>Additionally, a project website will be created containing a project
description and links to the codebase. Reports documenting our project
results will also be published on the project website.</p>
