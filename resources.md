## DCLL Library

Our project is based on the library for Deep Continuous Learning (DECOLLE) by
Jacques Kaiser, Hesham Mostafa and Emre Neftei. DECOLLE is a novel learning technique
for spiking neural networks which works often better on deep Spiking Neural Networks
than previously proposed techniques.

**Paper:** [Synaptic Plasticity Dynamics for
Deep Continuous Local Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10766.pdf)  

**Code:** [Github](https://github.com/nmi-lab/dcll)

## Brevitas

[Brevitas](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas) is a Python library to assist with training [quantized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing)) neural neworks
developed by Xilinx.

It was developed for researchers to train for reduced precision inference.

## Spiking Neural Networks

A description of the neuron model used in this project (SRM0) can be found in
the book [Spiking Neuron Models](https://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/BUCH.html) by
Wulfram Gerstner and Werner M. Kistler.

The chapter is available online [Spike Response Model (SRM)](https://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/node27.html#7902).
